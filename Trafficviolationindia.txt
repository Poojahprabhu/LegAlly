Important road safety rules
Safety should be the priority regardless of whether you are a pedestrian, cyclist or riding/driving a vehicle. In this section, let’s discuss some of the important road safety rules in India.

Road safety rules for pedestrians
Here are the important road safety rules for pedestrians.

1. Follow traffic signal rules 
As a pedestrian, always watch out for the traffic lights and only cross the road when the pedestrian light is green. Never cross the road when the light is green for vehicular traffic.

2. Do not use mobile phones on the road
Talking or texting on your mobile while walking on the road can be dangerous. For instance, if you are busy on your phone while crossing the road, it can lead to an accident. So avoid it at all costs.

3. Look before crossing the road
Make sure that you look in both directions (left and right) when crossing the road. That way, you will be safe from the oncoming traffic and the vehicles coming from the wrong direction (if any).

4. Use Zebra crossings
As a pedestrian, always use zebra crossings to cross the road at busy intersections and crossroads. Along with the Zebra crossing, follow the pedestrian traffic light rules.

Road safety rules for drivers (cyclists, riders and drivers)
Here are the traffic safety rules for cyclists and vehicle drivers/riders in India.

1. Do not ignore traffic light rules
Traffic lights are designed to enable smooth traffic flow at intersections, crossroads and zebra crossings. Following traffic signal rules ensures that there are no or minimal road mishaps. As a vehicle driver, always stop at red lights. Failing to do so can attract a red light jump fine. Also, give way for pedestrians at the zebra crossing. Cross the intersection only when the light is green. The same rules apply to cyclists as well.

2. Never drink and drive
Drinking-and-driving is one of the major causes of accidents on roads. Never drive your vehicle in an inebriated state. It not only causes harm to you but also to other road users. 

Alcohol can hamper your decision-making abilities. Hence, the chances of you losing control of the vehicle is high. So, avoid driving at all costs if you have consumed alcohol.

3. Do not use the mobile phone while driving
Mobile phones can be one of the biggest distractions while driving. It makes you take your eyes off the road and doing that while driving can be dangerous. Never talk or text on the phone while you are behind the wheel of a vehicle or riding a two-wheeler.

4. Follow speed limits
Whether you are driving a car or riding a two-wheeler, always adhere to the speed limits of that particular road. Never overspeed as it can result in you losing control of the vehicle and causing an accident. Always watch out for speed limit sign boards, especially on highways.

5. Follow “No Entry” zone rules
Never enter a “No Entry” zone as it may lead to serious accidents. Such zones are created for the one-way movement of traffic. If you enter that zone, you may end up colliding with oncoming traffic. Hence, never drive your vehicle in a “No Entry” zone.

6. Use turn signals
It is extremely important to use turn signals (indicator lights) to indicate your next manoeuvre on the road. For instance, if you wish to turn right at the next intersection, use a turn signal in advance and then slow down the vehicle. It helps avoid unnecessary confusion and collisions.

Turn signals are crucial for two-wheeler riders as they are more vulnerable to collisions. Hence, always use turn signal indicators to be safe on the road.

7. Slow down at intersections
Do not drive at high speeds when you are about to approach an intersection. Slow down the vehicle, look in both directions and then cross the intersection.

8. Give way for emergency vehicles
Always give way for emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire brigade trucks or Police vehicles. 

9. Follow lane rules
Following lane discipline is crucial, especially on traffic-congested roads. Whether you drive a car or ride a bike, do not make abrupt lane changes. If you wish to change lanes, use turn signals and complete the manoeuvre when it's safe. Also, avoid overtaking vehicles from the left side and stick to the right-side lane if you need to overtake a vehicle.

10. Wear proper safety gears
Wearing proper safety gear can protect you in case of an accident. Four-wheeler drivers and front co-passengers must always wear a seat belt while the vehicle is on the move. Two-wheeler riders and pillion riders must wear a helmet while riding to avoid serious injuries in case of a fall.
